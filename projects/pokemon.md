This ICS 211 final project, which is to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your Pokemon species hierarchy. This is my first time to build GUI, and it is interesting because there are some buttons and pictures that can make the user interface looks nice and easy to shows what you code result for the user instead of printing the result in the black window, which will make users feel confused. my group members using java for this project, and java is one of an object-oriented language, so each group member can complete their own part of the project. This project changed my thoughts on how programming is boring and it is all about sitting there all day just to type in code and waiting for output, so I think a good programmer should make a beautiful user interface to absorb users, they will enjoy the process of building a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
