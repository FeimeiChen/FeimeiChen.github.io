Coding a gobang game was my first project. It was a simple and interesting project because I liked to play gobang with my friends since I was a child. Therefore, I really happy to code this project. In this project, I code a chessboard first, then player chose their location. If five chess pieces in a line, the game should be terminated and print the winnerâ€™s name. However, this game only works in the black window, so I cannot play it with my friend who is not an ICS student.  Therefore, So I realized that I should learn more knowledge about programming in order to make a perfect game, such as having a good user interface and using a picture to make a bigger chessboard.

More and more children and even parents are playing video games in their free time. After this project, I realized that I really enjoyed writing games, so I decided to study hard and learn more skills in order to  making games. C is my first programming language, so I'm more familiar with it than other languages. In other words, it shaped my thinking, and while I was working with Java and other languages, I accidentally wrote code in C, which made my Java code fail. This project increased my interest in coding.
