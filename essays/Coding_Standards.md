** enhance efficiency
Coding standards are very important for programmers and readers because they can understand easily and faster. For example, when I reviewed my code that doesnâ€™t follow the rules such as proper naming and using useful comments, I felt that I have to rewrite it again to understand how I coded because my code is so messy, which is really waster time due to poor coding. Thus, a clear code can enhance efficiency and reduce the mistake that you code.
** For teamwork 
As we know, people all willing to read a clear and Concise essay, and the code like an essay. If the code looks nice, the reader will more willing to read your codes and hope to work with you on a project. Therefore, a good coding style is important for programmers. Besides, we can easily and fast understand a new programming language by coding standards because we can save time to correct coding style errors.
** the benefits of ESLint 
After using the ESLint within IntelliJ, I feel that which is an excellent way to help us to make code more readable and clear. Even though there are some errors about coding standards when I code, which make me uncomfortable and even want to stop coding to fix it, but I try to code the whole program, then to solve the warnings that begin with ESLint. In addition, ESLint can automatically notify me that there have syntax errors and stylistic issues, which help me to make my code more readable and easy to understand. However, I have to download those three files such as .eslintrc in every new project  and run it in the terminal. Maybe I am not familiar with how to configuring ESLint, so something there are some issue happens in this process. In general, ESLint can code more readable, which is beneficial for teamwork in the future.
