## Enhance Efficiency
Coding standards are important to programmers and readers because they can be understood more quickly and easily. For example, when I check code that doesn't follow the rules such as using proper naming and useful comments, I feel like I have to rewrite the code to understand how I'm coding because my code is so cluttered that it's really a waste of time because of the bad code. Therefore, clean code increases efficiency and reduces the number of errors in your code.
## For Team Work 
As we all know, people like to read a clear and concise article, and code is like an article. If the code looks good, readers will be more likely to read your code and want to work with you on the project. Therefore, a good coding style is important for programmers. In addition, we can easily and quickly understand a new programming language through coding standards, because we can do not need to waste time to correct coding style errors.
## The benefits of ESLint
After using ESLint in IntelliJ, I felt this was a good way to help us make our code easier to read and cleaner. Although there were some bugs with coding standards while I was writing code that made me feel uncomfortable and even wanted to stop coding to fix it, I tried writing the entire program and then addressing the warnings that started with ESLint. In addition, ESLint can automatically notify me of syntax errors and style issues, which helps me make my code easier to read and understand. However, I have to download the three files in each new project, such as.eslintrc, and run it from the terminal. Maybe I'm not familiar with how to configure ESLint, so there will be some problems along the way. In general, ESLint helps us write code that is more readable, which is good for us and for future team work.
