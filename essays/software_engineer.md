## Interest 
I decided to become an ICS student because my uncle is a software engineer and he is the richest person in my family. He started a company with more than 20 programmers. Therefore, I think becoming an ICS student will have a better future. To prove this idea, I searched for the average salary of software engineers, which led me to believe that software engineers pay more than other jobs. As we know, computers have changed the world by changing the way we communicate, think and live. For example, student can use Youtube or Googel to learn skills and knowledge. Therefore, I am interested in becoming a software engineer due to the fulfilling salary and its important and deep impact on the world.

## Learning 
 I learned C language in my freshman year, and it was not difficult for me to understand. 3 years ago, I moved to the US to continue my ICS course at KCC, but I realize that I have a huge language barrier, which reduce the efficiency of learning a new skill and even make it harder for me to understand what professors  saying. But I still want to get a degree in computer science. In addition, I learned from the ICS courses that these languages have similar syntax. Therefore, if I spend enough time on learn JavaScript, I believe that I will control it.
## The Goal
  In this semester, I want to manipulate JavaScript to make websites. Aslo, I hope that I manipulate other computer language, and improve my english. In general, I should write code everyday which will make me better at coding, and read code books in English instead of in Chinese, which can help me understand the problem in a shorter time, so that I can finish the code faster in WODs. In general, it is important for me to improve English and programming skills and experience for my future.
