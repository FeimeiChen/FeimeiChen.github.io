## Personal Experience 
I am taking ICS314 and ICS311 this semester. Others told me that they are really really hard, and one of them failed it. Due to COVID-19, students have more challenges to take it, especially me. I still remember that I always communicated with TA and my Professor through Discord because I misunderstood the requirements of WOD in class and homework. Fortunately, they are very nice to figure out my problem, which helps me to continue to take it until now and pass it with an A. From ICS 314, I learned how to build a website, and how to use the console to know the open source codes of the website. As we know, by reading those excellent open source codes, students can increase their programming skills because they can know how to code more standard for others, and make User-interface more beautiful. 
## Coding Standards 
Coding standards are very important for group work, in addition programmers should work with others in any company because they cannot finish any project by themselves in a short time. In my opinion, Code standard is like the law in daily life, if people break the law, which will create a problem for society. In other words, Code standard can help software engineers to avoid waste time on explain their code to other due to messy code. In our final project,  we obey use Eslint to check our coding style, and make our code looks nice. Also, we can easily to understand what our teammates code. Thus, Coding standard can make code more readable and increacre  efficiency
## Ethics in Software Engineering
Each software is built for users, so programmers should satisfy any requirement from the user, and make the user-interface more clearly and easy to use. In addition, programmers can not code malwares. Thus, Ethics in software engineering is a critical topic for building an application because many programmers lose their future due to disobeying the ethics in software engineering. If users use our software, we have a responsibility to protect their information. With the development of the Internet, people can use softwares to make their life more convenient and work more efficiently. For example, people can stay home to buy food and work, which can make their credit card information can be exposed to others, if the programmer does not obey the ethics. Also, For example, viruses attack our computer system and make the system unable to work normally. Trojan horses attack our data, resulting in the disclosure of our personal privacy and state secrets; Phishing sites lure people into fraud, cause people to lose money. Those damages are created by programmers who are good at programming skills but lack ethics.  Therefore,  the programmers have good ethics is more important than manipulating the programming skill well because people have the responsibility to keep the peace of our state.
