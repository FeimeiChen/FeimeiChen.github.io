## UI Framework Makes It easy to Build Websites
UI Frameworks can help us to build new websites easily and conveniently. Such as Semantic UI. Using those frameworks, we don’t need to create an element start from scratch, which saves time and makes building a website become easier for a new programmer. In other words, without using UI Frameworks, programmers have to create a satisfied website by coding with Javascript, HTML, and CSS and have to write more code in the CSS file and HTML file to make your website match your goal, which is very harder for a new programmer. Thus, Using UI Frameworks reduce the workload. Therefore, UI Frameworks benefit programmers, especially new programmers to build a professional website and make building websites become not very complicated tesk for people. 

## It Is Benefit For Teamwork
UI Frameworks can provide a common platform for a group,  which increases efficiency for teamwork because they can easily understand each other’s code, then fix others’ bugs. As we know, programmers build a new website or others for users, so we have to test out code, and fix it in order to make it be accepted. However, every bid project needs more than one person to work on it, so they should have a common framework to increase efficiency and reduce the risk of bugs. Thus, UI Frameworks can help a group of developers to enhance their efficiency to reduce the stress from different kinds of bugs due to different coding styles or habits.
## Personal Expericence

After working with semantic UI, I realized that even though not having to write much code in CSS files, it is not as easy as I thought. For example, when I started using it, I spent a lot of time figuring out which elements or containers would help me to build a new website. Fortunately, semantic UI is designed as a natural language, which helps us understand and find what we need as quickly as possible.  In general, using a UI framework helps us draw on the best experiences of others and prevents us from wasting time doing the wrong things or exploring. It also needs takes time to get familiar with the UI framework, which is like a library, and while we can't read every book in the library, we should know where it is when we need it. Besides, reading more books in this library can help us get familiar with it. If you are familiar with it, it is really good for us to build a more professional, more beautiful new website.
