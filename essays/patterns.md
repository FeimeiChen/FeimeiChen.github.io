## Why Design Patterns Are Important
  As we know, computers change our lifestyle, however, computers and software are created by smart people. Those smart software engineers share their experience with others, learn more knowledge about computers and coding, which avoid new software engineers from wasting their time to find the solution that those smart people already know. There is a team that we called Gang of four, they conclude server design patterns for us, which make us code more reusable and more efficient. Thus,  those design patterns are very important because they are general, reusable solutions.
  
## Personal Experience 
    After attending the final project of ICS 314, I realized how important the design pattern is. In this project, we use Meteor and implement some design patterns to build our website, making us build our website in a short time. In other words, I can not imagine how difficult it would be if we do not use the Meteor and implement others design patterns because I seem to even do not know how to begin to code our website.  In addition, we use the prototype design pattern which comes from javascript, Publish-Subscribe design pattern, and Model-View-Controller design pattern, those two are from Meteor. Also, the singleton pattern is used by us to create the website. 
    
## Conclusion
      [A design pattern] “ describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice” - Christopher Alexander, 1977. Therefore, a design pattern provides us a reusable solution to solve a common problem, and which is beneficial for teamwork, we do not need to explain to others how we find those solutions. Design patterns are the key to how we build websites, so we cannot without them because we have to build out a website from scratch which is very challenging for us.
