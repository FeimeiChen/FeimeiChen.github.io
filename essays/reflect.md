JavaScript is one of the most useful scripting languages for making web pages. It is easier to manipulate it than C language and java. In other words, people can understand it quickly after control C language and java because they have some similar syntax. However, C language and Java are statically typed language, but JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. Thus, programmers must specify what type each variable is before running the program when they use C language and Java, but they do not have to specify the type of variables in declaring variables in JavaScript. For example, if programmers using JavaScript, they just use var, const, or let to declare any type of variables, but there are some keywords such as int that is an integer type, and float that is a shortened term for floating points to distinguish between floating-point and integers in C language. In addition, ES6 makes JavaScript more convenient, and lets code become cleaner, short, and easier to understand for programmers.


the practice WODS can help students to control JavaScript which is an interesting language to help them to make web pages. Therefore, take more and more practice WODS  is useful for students to control JavaScript and acquire full points in WODs. when I took the practice WODs, I did not feel nervous and finish it in less than average time. However, I felt very nervous before and during taking WODs, which makes me that misspelled the word length instead of length. I  spend more than 5 minutes finding this misspelled error, and as time went by I was more nervous, which seems to make my brain stop thinking. Fortunately, I find this error at the last minute. Thus, I need to take more practice WODs and pretend it is a really WOD and hope I can be calm in the next WODs to finish it as soon as possible.


In general, if students should finish code in a limited time, which makes some students be influenced because they will feel nervous and even forgot everything that they should know under time pressure, especially myself.  In a limited time, students should come up with a solution quickly and then start to code. In other words, if they get the wrong solution from the start, it means they have no chance to finish the problem on time. Therefore, WODs require that we have a complete understanding of JavaScript syntax and must check that the solution is correct before we start to code. people can relieve pressure come from worrying do not have enough time by taking the practice WODs. Taking WODs is a good way to judge whether students should improve their skills and learn more knowledge about JavaScript and others to promote their abilities. Even though it is stressful, students will feel happy after slove it on time. This style of learning can remind me that I should keep learning if I spend more time than the average time, so it is useful for me.
