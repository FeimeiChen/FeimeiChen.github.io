JavaScript is one of the most useful scripting languages for making web pages. It is easier to manipulate it than C language and java. In other word, people can understand it quickly after control C language and java because they have some similar syntax. However, C language and Java is statically typed language, but JavaScript is dynamically typed language. Thus, programmers must specify what type each variable is before running program when they use C language and Java, but they do not have to specify the type of variables in declaring variables in JavaScript. For example, if programmers using JavaScript, they just use var, const, or let to declare any type of variables, but there are some keywords such as int that is an integer type and float that is a shortened term for floating points to distinguish between floating-point and integers in C language. In addition, ES6 makes JavaScript more convenient, and let code become cleaner, short and easier to understand for programmers.
In the practice WODS, the student should count time to know how long they can solve the problem, which makes some students be influenced, especially myself because they will feel nervous and even forgot everything that they should know during time pressure. However, people get used to finishing code before the deadline and relieve pressure come from faring do not have enough time and this is a good way to check whether students should improve their skills and learn more knowledge about JavaScript and others to promote they abilities. Even though it is stressful, students can feel happy after slove it in time. This style of learning can remind me that I should keep learning if I spend more time than average time, so it is useful for me.
In general, the practice WODS can help students to control JavaScript which is an interesting language to help them to make web pages and make them do not be panic in WOD to achieve their goal such as pass the class. Therefore, it is useful for students to pursue their goals.
