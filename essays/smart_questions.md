## When and Why Student Should Ask Good Questions    
As students learn a new skill and knowledge, they will have more and more problems and even feel confused. When we are faced with an unsolved problem, we will try to solve it by ourselves, but even though we spend a lot of time, we still can't solve it.  For example, we read technical books, use Google to search for information, even watch YouTube learn anything about it, but we still can't solve it. At this time, asking others is a good and effective way to help us solve the problem. We know that with the development of the Internet, students can use Google and other websites to search for questions. Besides, asking the question the smart way by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board can help students to get help in a shorter time.
## How to Ask Questions Smart Way
There are some principles for how to ask a problem a smart way. Students should state their questions clearly and briefly so that others can understand what they are having trouble with, otherwise if more experienced people feel you ask stupidly, they will unwilling to waste their time to understand what students express and just ignore it. Besides, even though the problem is urgent for you to solve, you should be patient and ask the problem politely because they don’t have a responsibility to help you to solve problems immediately, so asking politely will increase the chances to acquire help and solution. However, students should not be allowed to ask others to get the answers to the homework, because students should understand the questions on the homework, to gain the abilities and skills they should control. In other words, students can ask for a hint about homework instead of an answer. As we know, when facing the same question, different students have different solutions due to different thoughts. Thus, asking questions to a well-selected public forum such as stack overflow benefits us to get the most useful solution because they are a lot of more experienced and professional people to respond to your questions, however, if you ask a question about programming in a public food forum, people will ignore your question maybe because they don’t know any programming knowledge. In general, students should smartly ask questions to acquire help as soon as possible.
## Good Exmaple and Bad Example
 There is a [good example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname?rq=1) help us to how to ask in a smart way. This question is short and clear subject, and then the code for function(){} and function functionName(){} is shown below and decribe his problem. So there were a lot of experienced people who explained the difference to him. Also, it's good for people who feel confused like him, such as me, so I read the answers to his questions to find out what differences they have. If you ask the question in an unsmart way, you maybe cannot acquire a useful help. For exmaple, this is a [bad way](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/86619/how-can-i-download-install-linux-on-a-windows-pc-while-using-windows-as-little-a?rq=1) to ask question. The question is hard to read because it is unclear,and there only sentences to describe, he even did not tell us any inforemation about his brother computer, so there only one person willing to help him. In addition, people ask problems in smart way by describing the problem's symptoms, not guessing.In general, asking questions in a smart way is important for us to solve problems and avoid wasting the time of the person who are willing to helps you.
