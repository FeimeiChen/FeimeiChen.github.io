## When and Why Student Should Ask Good Questions    
As students learn a new skill and knowledge, they will have more and more problems and even feel confused. When we are faced with an unsolved problem, we will try to solve it by ourselves, but even though we spend a lot of time, we still can't solve it.  For example, we read technical books, use Google to search for information, even watch YouTube to learn anything about it, but we still can't solve it. At this time, asking others is a good and effective way to help us solve the problem. We know that with the development of the Internet, students can use Google and other websites to search for questions. In addition, asking the question the smart way by e-mail, or in a newsgroup, or on a website chat board can help students to get help in a shorter time.
## How to Ask Questions Smart Way
There are some principles for how to ask a problem a smart way. Students should state their questions clearly and briefly so that others can understand what they are having trouble with, otherwise, if more experienced people feel you ask in a stupid way, they will unwilling to waste their time to understand what students express and just ignore it. In addition, even though the problem is urgent for you to solve, you should be patient and ask the problem politely because they don’t have a responsibility to help you to solve problems immediately, so asking politely will increase the chances to acquire help and solution. However, students should not be allowed to ask others to get the answers to the homework, because students should understand the questions on the homework, so as to gain the abilities and skills they should control. In other words, students can ask for a hint about homework instead of an answer. As we know, when facing the same question, different students have different solutions due to different thoughts. Thus, asking questions to a well-selected public forum such as stack overflow benefits us to get the most useful solution because they are a lot of more experienced and professional people to respond to your questions, however, if you ask a question about programming in a public forum that about share foods, people will ignore your question maybe because they don’t know any knowledge about programming. In general, students should ask questions in a smart way in order to acquire help as soon as possible.
